## Schizophrenia?


Schizophrenia is a severe and disabling mental illnesses which has no well-established, non-invasive diagnosis biomarker. Currently, due to its symptom overlap with other mental illnesses (like bipolar disorder) it can only be diagnosed subjectively, by process of elimination.

This is a devastating neuropsychiatric disorder affecting around 0.3–0.7% of the population throughout the world. Its etiology is largely unknown, but likely multifactorial with substantial contribution of genetic and prenatal factors . 

Since the 19th Century, after E. Kraepelin’s description of “dementia praecox” and then introduction of the term “schizophrenia” by E. Bleuler, this concept undergone many revisions, and is still a matter of hot debates.
